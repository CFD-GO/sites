## Abstract
Â© 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.We discuss a methodology for multiobjective optimization of the U-shaped air-delivery duct, which is a part of a turboprop engine intake system. The methodology combines and extends existing techniques to optimize the real-world engineering problem efficiently. The procedure utilizes Kriging models for the approximation of objective functions. We use the Expected Hypervolume Improvement method for improving the Kriging models accuracy and creating the Pareto front. The calculations are parallel and asynchronous, allowing to reduce the time needed for finding the optimal designs. The algorithm is resistant to solver failures and mesh issues. We perform the optimization with a purpose to satisfy two objectives: reduction of a total pressure loss across the duct and improvement/not-worsening of a distortion coefficient at the duct outlet. To obtain the improvement, we modify the shape of the duct within limits to fulfill geometric constraints. We use 30 design variables to control the deformation of the duct surface based on radial basis function interpolation.
