## Abstract
In this article, an analysis of a manufacturing process for small aerodynamic elements is presented. Two manufacturing methods - selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) - were investigated. For both, the same additional surface-processing method was applied to obtain the desired surface properties. The geometry of the manufactured elements at different stages of surface processing was observed and tested with a profilometer and a scanner to quantify deviations. Process deviations were classified and quantified. The aerodynamic performance and practical application of the models and methods are discussed in this article.
