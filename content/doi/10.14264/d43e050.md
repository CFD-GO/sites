## Abstract
Spectral-filtered nanofluids have shown the potential to improve the performance of CPV/T collectors. Such nanofluids can absorb some of the radiation of incoming light to harness thermal energy and increase the PV cell performance by only transmitting the useful spectral range. This study aims to develop a model that can be used to understand the influence of parameters such as mass flow rate, nanofluid volume fraction, and ambient temperature, on CPV/T performance. This work presents numerical simulations of nanofluids in a CPV/T collector, while the optical and thermal modelling of the nanofluid is coupled with a non-gray radiation model. Local ambient conditions have been used to evaluate the monthly variation of energy output. An optimised geometry and flow condition is determined, which can significantly reduce the thermal losses. Finally, the achievable exergy yield of the collector can be used to estimate the energy production rate in a variable atmospheric condition.
