## Abstract
This study analyses the propagation of Taylor bubbles through vertical and inclined annular pipes. An established phase-field lattice Boltzmann method (PFLBM) was employed to resolve the multiphase flow dynamics. This analysis was motivated by the two-phase slug flow commonly observed in oil and gas wells and pipelines. The work makes contributions to two fundamental areas relating to Taylor bubbles in annular pipes. Firstly, the derivation of a drift velocity correlation for Taylor bubbles in vertical annular pipe is presented. The database covered fluids with Eötvös numbers between 10 and 700 and Morton numbers between 10-6 and 100. From here, the incorporation of inclination effects is discussed along with the respective correlation. Future work will assess the effects of pipe eccentricity as well as the interaction of consecutive Taylor bubbles. Furthermore, model development has also begun to study non-Newtonian and thermal effects.
