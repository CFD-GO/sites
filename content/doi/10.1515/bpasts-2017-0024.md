## Abstract
The present paper discusses an effective adaptive methods suited for use in parallel environment. An in-house, parallel flow solver based on the residual distribution method is used for the solution of flow problems. Simulation is parallelized based on the domain decomposition approach. Adaptive changes to the mesh are achieved by two distinctive techniques. Mesh refinement is performed by dividing element edges and a subsequent application of pre defined splitting templates. Mesh regularization and derefinement is achieved through topology conserving node movement (r-adaptivity). Parallel implementations of an adaptive use the dynamic load balancing technique.
