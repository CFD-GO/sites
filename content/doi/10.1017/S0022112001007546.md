## Abstract
Linear stability analysis of flow in a channel bounded by wavy walls is considered. It is shown that wall waviness gives rise to an instability that manifests itself through generation of streamwise vortices. The available results suggest that the critical stability criteria based on the Reynolds number based on the amplitude of the waviness can be formulated.
