## Abstract
We characterise the incompressible turbulence cascade in terms of the concurrent inter-scale and inter-space exchanges of the scale-by-scale energy, helicity and enstrophy. The governing equations for the scale-by-scale helicity and enstrophy are derived in a similar fashion to that of the second order structure function following Hill (J. FluidMech., vol. 468, 2002, pp. 317.326). We examine the instantaneous dynamics, applying these equations to forced periodic turbulence and a von Karman flow focusing on scales in the dissipative range r = 2.5η, the near-dissipative range r = 0.5λ and the onset inertial range r = λ (where η and λ are the Kolmogorov and Taylor length scales, respectively). The signature of the random sweeping effect is observed in all three individual budgets and between the energy and enstrophy transfers. As in the energy cascade, the anti correlation of the pressure transport and non-linear transfer is identified also in the helicity cascade. Owing to its lack of positive definiteness, the helicity transfers are found to be decorrelated from the others. However a connection between the energy cascade and helicity is identified kinematically. This connection reveals the large-scale sweeping motions are a key element in the overall energy cascade and underpins previous observations of large-scale intermittency. Taken together, this work extends a classic framework to gain novel insight on turbulence dynamics that underlay the statistically steady state, and demonstrates how transfers are interconnected.
