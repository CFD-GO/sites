## Abstract
We present detailed experiments on transient growth of turbulent spots induced by external forcing in plane Couette-Poiseuille flow, which are studied in the framework of linear transient growth. The experimental investigation is supplemented with full theoretical analysis. We compare quantitatively the experimental and theoretical results, including maximal gain and the time at which it occurs. We also present the limits of validity for the application of the linear theory at high amplitude perturbation and Reynolds number, showing experiments with self-sustained states.
