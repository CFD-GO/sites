## Abstract
We present a novel technique to render objects invisible to incident waves in a water waveguide system with parallel walls at low frequencies. The invisibility of a waveguide defect, specifically a vertical surface-piercing circular cylinder, is achieved through local deformations of the waveguide walls in the immediate vicinity of the defect. Our method results in a reflection coefficient that is at least 20 times lower than in the case of a parallel waveguide. The effect is observed over a broad frequency range. Experimental results confirm the high efficiency of our approach, showing that backscattered energy is reduced by a factor of 100-5000 compared with the reference case within the considered frequency range.
