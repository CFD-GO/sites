## Abstract
Ahwaz oilfield is one of the southern Iranian fields in the Middle East that are located in reverse fault stress regime. Wells A and B are two deviated wells with same drilling conditions that produce oil from Bangestan reservoir in Ahwaz oilfield. Numerous cases of borehole instability, stuck pipe, and borehole collapse have been reported while drilling well B. These problems cause highly increasing of drilling operation cost of well B. However, well A has been drilled without any serious problems. To investigate and avoid these problems and improving operating costs of drilling, a comprehensive mechanical stability analysis is essential. To do so, a computer program is developed to analyze the mechanical stability of these deviated wellbores. The mechanical stability analysis reveals that in the reverse fault stress regime, drilling in direction of maximum horizontal stress is the most stable direction. But drilling in direction of minimum horizontal stress, leads serious borehole instability and borehole collapse. Comparing the results with trajectory of two deviated wells, show that well A has been drilled in direction close to the maximum horizontal stress while well B has been drilled in direction of minimum horizontal stress. As result well A must be more stable than well B. Base on the results the best drilling direction in Ahwaz oilfield is parallel to maximum horizontal stress. Â© 2010, Society of Petroleum Engineers.
