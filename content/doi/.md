## Abstract
Flow modifications induced by distributed surface suction with a fixed/moving pattern have been considered. Very small suction levels with a properly selected pattern can induce very large changes in the flow. The mechanics of flow response can be explained in some generality using linear theory. The available results permit optimal selection of suction that maximizes flow response.
