## Abstract
A whole genome scan for quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting 11 fleece and wool traits was carried out in a flock of medium wool Merino sheep. The flock consisted of 489 sheep in 5 sire groups with family sizes ranging from 59 to 139 offspring. On average 73% of the animals in each family were genotyped with a panel of 130 microsatellite markers spread throughout the genome. Interval analysis of the data revealed 18 peaks with maximum logarithm of the odds scores (LOD) â‰¥ 2. Critical P-values for QTL detection, accounting for the large number of hypotheses tested, were estimated by calculating the expected false discovery rate (FDR). For the distribution of LOD score peaks found the FDR always exceeded 0.65 indicating that little evidence was found against all null hypotheses of no QTL present. Evidence for a QTL affecting mean fibre diameter (LOD=2.01) was found on chromosome 1 in agreement with previously reported results of a candidate gene study. The results of the present study may be useful to indicate chromosomal segments on which to concentrate future genotyping for QTL although the conservative conclusion that must be drawn is that no significant evidence for the segregation of fleece and wool QTL was found in this flock.
