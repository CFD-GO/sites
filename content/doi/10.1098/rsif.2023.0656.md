## Abstract
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) often coexist and pose significant risks of mortality, yet their mutual interactions remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce a fluid mechanics model designed to simulate the haemodynamic impact of PAD on AAA-associated risk factors. Our focus lies on quantifying the uncertainty inherent in controlling the flow rates within PAD-affected vessels and predicting AAA risk factors derived from wall shear stress. We perform a sensitivity analysis on nine critical model parameters through simulations of three-dimensional blood flow within a comprehensive arterial geometry. Our results show effective control of the flow rates using two-element Windkessel models, although specific outlets need attention. Quantities of interest like endothelial cell activation potential (ECAP) and relative residence time are instructive for identifying high-risk regions, with ECAP showing greater reliability and adaptability. Our analysis reveals that the uncertainty in the quantities of interest is 187% of that of the input parameters. Notably, parameters governing the amplitude and frequency of the inlet velocity exert the strongest influence on the risk factorsâ€™ variability and warrant precise determination. This study forms the foundation for patient-specific simulations involving PAD and AAAs which should ultimately improve patient outcomes and reduce associated mortality rates.
