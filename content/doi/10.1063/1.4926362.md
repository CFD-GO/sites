## Abstract
We explore an Îµ-near-zero analogue for water waves using deep water and shallow water domains to obtain different phase velocities. Being inherently non linear, water waves permit to inspect focusing of harmonically generated waves. Experimental measurements show cascade of focal spots up to the fourth harmonic, allowing sub wavelength focusing with respect to the first harmonic wavelength.
