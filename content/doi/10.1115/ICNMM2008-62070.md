## Abstract
Instability of a viscous incompressible flow in a channel with wavy walls is investigated theoretically, numerically and experimentally. Linear stability analysis shows that appropriately chosen wall waviness leads to flow destabilization at surprisingly low Reynolds numbers. The unstable mode of disturbances forms a vortex array, which travels downstream. The remarkable feature is that the most destabilizing waviness does not introduce any additional flow resistance. The outcome of the stability analysis are consistent with the result of direct numerical simulation obtained using CFD finite volume package FLUENT (Ansys Inc.). Preliminary experimental data gained for a channel with appropriately corrugated wall seem to confirm these predictions. Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME.
