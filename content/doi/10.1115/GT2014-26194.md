## Abstract
The aim of the present study is to verify the ability of a hybrid RANS/LES model, based on the newest version of the RANS k-ù model of Wilcox (2008), in reproducing the flow in a rib-roughened rotating channel. The numerical results are compared to experimental data by Coletti and Arts (2011), and Coletti et al. (2012). Results obtained with the basic RANS k-ù model are analysed as well, with and without the correction term for frame rotation by Hellsten (1998). It is demonstrated that the hybrid RANS/LES k-(i) model produces accurate results for the rotating ribbed duct flow. However, the RANS model with the correction term for frame rotation produces quite good results as well for mean velocity profiles, although not as good as with the hybrid model. Further, the RANS model has lower quality in the representation of the small-scale fluctuations.
