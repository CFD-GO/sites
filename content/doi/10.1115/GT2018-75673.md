## Abstract
Â© Copyright 2018 ASME.A simulation of the flow through a four-stage low pressure turbine (LPT) of an aero-engine is performed using an eddyviscosity based RANS model. An analysis of secondary flow details in the vicinity of endwalls and strut surface is performed. An interaction of wakes generated by the swirler vanes and endwall boundary layers is also studied. The CFD results are compared with own test rig data of LPT obtained in Polonia Aero Lab in Zielonka (Poland). Global flow parameters were reproduced in good agreement with experiment (difference less than 1.5%). Satisfactory agreement between measured and predicted pressure distribution on the surface of inlet strut has been obtained.
