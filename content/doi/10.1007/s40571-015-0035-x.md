## Abstract
This paper describes the development of a computational framework that can be used to describe the electromagnetic excitation of rigid, spherical particles in suspension. In this model the mechanical interaction and kinematic behaviour of the particles is modelled using the discrete element method, while the surrounding fluid mechanics is modelled using the lattice Boltzmann method. Electromagnetic effects are applied to the particles as an additional set of discrete element forces, and the implementation of these effects was validated by comparison to the theoretical equations of point charges for Coulombâ€™s law and the Lorentz force equation. Oscillating single and multiple particle tests are used to investigate the sensitivity of particle excitation to variations in particle charge, field strength, and frequency. The further capabilities of the model are then demonstrated by a numerical illustration, in which a hydraulic fracture fluid is excited and monitored within a hydraulic fracture. This modelling explores the feasibility of using particle vibrations within the fracture fluid to aid in the monitoring of fracture propagation in unconventional gas reservoirs.
