## Abstract
Computations in Fluid Dynamics require minimisation of time in which the result could be obtained. While parallel techniques allow for handling of large problems, it is the adaptivity that ensures that computational effort is focused on interesting regions in time and space. Parallel efficiency, in a domain decomposition based approach, strongly depends on partitioning quality. For adaptive simulation partitioning quality is lost due to the dynamic modification of the computational mesh. Maintaining high efficiency of parallelization requires rebalancing of the numerical load. This paper presents performance results of an adaptive and dynamically balanced in-house flow solver. The results indicate that the rebalancing technique might be used to remedy to the adverse effects of adaptivity on overall parallel performance. Â© 2014 Springer-Verlag.
