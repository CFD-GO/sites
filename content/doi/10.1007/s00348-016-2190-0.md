## Abstract
A new technique of planar laser-induced fluorescence calibration is presented in this work. It accounts for a nonlinear dye response at high concentrations, an illumination light attenuation and a secondary fluorescence’s influence in particular. An analytical approximation of a generic solution of the Beer–Lambert law is provided and utilized for effective concentration evaluation. These features make the technique particularly well suited for high concentration measurements, or those with a large range of concentration values, c, present (i.e. a high dynamic range of c). The method is applied to data gathered in a water flume experiment where a stream of a fluorescent dye (rhodamine 6G) was released into a grid-generated turbulent flow. Based on these results, it is shown that the illumination attenuation and the secondary fluorescence introduce a significant error into the data quantification (up to 15 and 80 %, respectively, for the case considered in this work) unless properly accounted for.
