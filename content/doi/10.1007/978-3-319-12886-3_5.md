## Abstract
This paper considers a problem of generation of high-order anisotropic hybrid grids to be used for simulation of high-Reynolds number compressible turbulent flows around 3D geometries. The algorithm relies on generating a curvilinear structural grid in the boundary layer region, separately from the usual low-order unstructured grid in the rest of the computational domain. A grid deformator based on an elastic analogy is used in order to curved unstructured elements. The whole process is driven by the global spacing described in a form of a metric field. The presented method is verified for the OneraM6 wing and the L1T2 high lift testcases.
