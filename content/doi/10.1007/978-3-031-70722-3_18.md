## Abstract
This paper presents the concept of a soft-body robot. The robot applies a pneumatic drive system. Suction cups enable attachment to the ground and adaptive movement in various environments. The design concept of a robot is presented, emphasizing its universality. The design, production and mobility testing phases are summarised. Design variants are discussed. The experimental results illustrating the robot’s movement capabilities are briefly described. The work contributes to soft robotics, which uses the advantages of pneumatic drives.
