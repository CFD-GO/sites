## Abstract
Mesh Adaptation is a technique allowing to solve of complex problems by limiting the use of computational resources. In parallel simulation, adaptivity causes perturbation in numerical load balance leading to decrease in overall parallel efficiency. It is therefore vital to allow for dynamic load balancing if adaptive algoritms are to be run in parallel. In this paper authors present results from implementation of a dynamic load balancing algorithm to parallel and adaptive compressible flow solver. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
