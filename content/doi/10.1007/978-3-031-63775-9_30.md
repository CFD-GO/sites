## Abstract
Large eddy simulations (LES) are extensively employed in aerodynamics-related industrial research and applications. However, the application of lattice Boltzmann based LES techniques in vascular blood flow research is less extensively documented. This study investigates the feasibility of employing lattice Boltzmann based large eddy simulation techniques, specifically the Smagorinsky-based subgrid scale turbulence model, for simulating high Reynolds number blood flow at a coarse-grained resolution. Initially, a stenotic channel flow simulation is conducted, with results undergoing validation against existing experimental data and direct numerical simulation results, showing strong agreement for both. Subsequently, our model is applied to simulate aortic stenosis at a resolution of 100 μm, demonstrating the capability to model high Reynolds numbers around 4500, despite such flows conventionally requiring a resolution of around 20 μm. These results underscore the substantial promise of utilising LES techniques in blood flow simulations, benefiting not just the lattice Boltzmann method but also enlightening the broader computational fluid dynamics community. This approach offers advantages for large-scale human simulations at coarser resolutions.
