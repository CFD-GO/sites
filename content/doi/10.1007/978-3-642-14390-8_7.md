## Abstract
Large scale computing requires parallelization in order to arrive at solution at reasonable time. Today parallelization is a standard in fluid problems simulation. On the other hand adaptation is a technique that allows for dynamic modification of the mesh as the need for locally higher resolution arises. Adaptation used during parallel simulation leads to unbalanced numerical load. This in turn decreases the efficiency of parallelization. Dynamic load balancing strategies should be applied in order to ensure proper parallelization efficiency. The paper presents the potential benefits of applying the dynamic load balancing to adaptive flow problems simulated in parallel environments. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
