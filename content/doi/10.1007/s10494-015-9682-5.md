## Abstract
The objective of this work is to verify the capabilities of a hybrid k-ω RANS/LES model for simulation of the unsteady three-dimensional flow in a ribbed duct subjected to system rotation. The Reynolds number is 15,000 and the rotation number is 0.3, both based on hydraulic diameter and bulk velocity. A correction term for system rotation is introduced into the originating k-ω RANS model. Simulation results in the mid-span section are compared with experimental data by Coletti et al. (Exp. Fluids 52:1043–1061, 2012). The comparison is complemented by analysis of the flow features in cross-sections. It is demonstrated that the hybrid k-ω RANS/LES model produces an accurate simulation of the rotating ribbed duct flow. Results are compared with those by the originating time-accurate k-ω RANS model. The k-ω RANS model is not accurate concerning secondary features in the longitudinal mean flow recirculation patterns and the secondary flow in cross-sections, but it reproduces quite well the time-averaged longitudinal flow.
