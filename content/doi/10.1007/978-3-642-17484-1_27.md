## Abstract
This paper outlines a number of numerical techniques within a general combined Lattice Boltzmann-Discrete Element framework for the modeling of particle transport in incompressible fluid flows, with or without the presence of a thermal phase. The standard Lattice Boltzmann (LB) formulation for the simulation of incompressible fluid flows is reviewed, together with incorporation of the Smagorinsky turbulence model into the formulation. The hydrodynamic interactions between fluid and particles are realised through an immersed boundary condition. The extension of the linear LB formulation to non-Newtonian fluid regimes enables the modelling of fine particle migration problems in mass mining operations, while the double population based thermal LB approach permits the modelling of heat transfer phenomena in fluid-particle systems. The combination of some or all of these techniques offers an advanced and powerful numerical tool for the modelling of many important engineering problems. Â© 2011 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.
