## Abstract
The objective of the paper is to present the essential issues related to an effective computational implementation of a continuum/discontinuum formulation of rock masses under various loading conditions, including fluid interaction for two classes of problems; fluid flow through fracturing rock masses and rock blasting. The applicability of the methodology developed is illustrated through practical examples related to borehole breakout phenomena, hydraulic fracturing and the simulation of rock blasting operations Â© 2007 Taylor & Francis Group.
