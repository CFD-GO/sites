## Abstract
A completely spectral algorithm for analysis of flows over corrugated boundaries is proposed. The algorithm treats the flow problem as an internal rather then a boundary value problem, where the flow conditions are specified along a line in the interior of the computational domain. The method eliminates the need for a coordinate generation and/or premapping required for regularization of the computational domain in standard implementations of spectral discretizations. Various tests confirm the spectral accuracy of the algorithm. Â© 1999 Academic Press.
