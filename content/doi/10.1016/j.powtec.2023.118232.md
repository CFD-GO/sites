## Abstract
Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.The transport mechanism of densely-packed proppant bed is numerically investigated by the lattice Boltzmann-discrete element coupling method (LB-DEM). While many of the previous studies aimed at proppant-laden slurry flow, this study focuses on the bedload transport of the settled proppant in the primary fracture. By constructing an ideal horizontal fracture, a detailed study on proppant bed motion induced by shearing flow is performed. The results show that the particle flux increases quadratically with the fluid flux, from which a nonlinear relationship is concluded. Further investigations on sediment rheology indicate that the shear-thinning property of the proppant bed leads to such nonlinear variation. With the decrease of shear viscosity, an increasing portion of the proppant bed is driven by the fluid. The current research devotes to an optimised design for fracturing fluid injection scheme as well as a better proppant flowback control, which further contributes to an improved hydraulic fracturing operation.
