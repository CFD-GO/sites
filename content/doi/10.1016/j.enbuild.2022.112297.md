## Abstract
A hybrid numerical modelling approach has been developed and applied to investigate the performance of a spectrally-filtered concentrated photovoltaic thermal (SF-CPV/T) collector under local climate conditions. The approach couples the single-phase model for spectrally-filtered nanofluids and discrete ordinate (DO) radiation modelling to solve the radiative transport equation (RTE) of the solar participating media. To increase model accuracy, temperature-dependent thermophysical properties of working fluid and heat loss-coefficient are employed using existing correlations. This article makes contributions in three areas. First, the model, which was validated using published experimental data, is capable of capturing the thermal distribution in the three-dimensional geometry of the collector, which consists of several physical components (i.e. glass, filter thickness, air gap, and PV cell). Second, the direct-irradiance value can be effectively calculated when the non-gray radiation boundary is accounted for. Finally, the comparative performance of the collector when employing the local ambient and solar radiation data helps determine the best region for installing the SF-CPV/T collector. The results show that the current model can accurately predict the thermal and electrical output at given atmospheric conditions. Future studies will include the influence of nanoparticle concentration allowing for the heterogeneity of the suspension to influence performance of the SF-CPV/T collector.
