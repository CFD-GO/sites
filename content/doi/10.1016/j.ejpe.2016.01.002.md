## Abstract
© 2016 The AuthorsThe main aim of this work is to investigate gas–oil relative permeability curves as the main flow function in different gas injection scenarios, immiscible and near miscible in case of highly fractured reservoirs. In this research, some experiments have been done on the reservoir core sample selected from sandstone formation in one of the Iranian naturally fractured oil reservoirs. The core is saturated with oil sample and CO2 is injected into oil saturated core sample. Experiments have been performed on both of the sandstone and artificial fractured sandstone, represented as no fractured and highly fractured reservoirs, based on incremental pressure algorithm approaching into near miscible condition. Inverse modeling method has been used to calculate relative permeability curves. By comparing the relative permeability curves in immiscible and near-miscible conditions, the results show that in sandstone core type this change is considerable, but in highly artificial fractured sandstone with a high ratio of artificial fractured to sandstone absolute permeability (Kef /Ks) is not substantial. Moreover the results show that in the described case of artificial fractured core type so simple conventional relative permeability methods have the same results compared to a sophisticated inverse modeling method. The other main result is the lack of miscibility activation in near miscible injection through the highly fractured reservoirs leading to viscose dominant flow rather than capillary. Finally by considering this changing behavior, a better knowledge of gas front movement through highly fractured reservoirs in low IFT regions can be obtained.
