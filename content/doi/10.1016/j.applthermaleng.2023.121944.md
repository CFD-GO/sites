## Abstract
Solar energy, particularly solar thermal technology, has gained popularity as a possible long-term replacement to fossil fuels. The application of concentrated photovoltaic-solar thermal (CPV/T) collectors, which are improved by spectral filter fluids (SFF) and nanotechnology, has the potential to provide both higher thermal power for heating and cooling as well as improved electrical power generation. This work contributes new insight by quantifying the influence of nanoparticle agglomeration on collector performance and highlighting the challenges associated with the heterogeneous distribution of nanoparticles in CPV/T systems. The study employed coupled Eulerian multiphase modeling and discrete ordinate (DO) radiation modeling to examine slip velocity, nanoparticle diameter (including agglomeration), and suspension concentration. Population balance modeling (PBM) was utilized to determine the nanoparticle size distribution, and the obtained results were validated through comparison with experimental and numerical studies. When neglecting the effect of agglomeration and breakage of the non-solar participating media, the maximum error for this configuration was found to be 3.58% when compared to experimental work. From the solar participating study, in terms of electrical energy production, the best performance obtained was 16.64% with a volume fraction of 0.005% when considering agglomeration and breakage. It was also found that the Sauter diameter increases with volume fraction as the tendency for nanoparticle agglomeration increases. This study provides a broader view of the application of multiphase modeling in solar participating and non-solar participating media and, additionally, provides insight on the effect of various boundary conditions on the key system performance indicators. To extend this work, the flow Reynolds number can be increased in addition to varying the type of working fluid.
