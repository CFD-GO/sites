## Abstract
© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.The unique properties of ceramic foams make them well suited to a range of applications in science and engineering such as heat transfer, reaction catalysis, flow stabilization, and filtration. Consequently, a detailed understanding of the transport properties (i.e. permeability, pressure drop) of these foams is essential. This paper presents the results of both numerical and experimental investigations of the morphology and pressure drop in 10. ppi (pores per inch), 20. ppi and 30. ppi ceramic foam specimens with porosity in the range of 75-79%. The numerical simulations were carried out using a GPU implementation of the three-dimensional, multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method (MRT-LBM) on geometries of up to 360 million nodes in size. The experiments were undertaken using a water channel. Foam morphology (porosity and specific surface area) was studied on post-processed, computed tomography (CT) images, and the sensitivity of these results to CT image thresholding was also investigated. Comparison of the numerical and experimental data for pressure drop exhibited very good agreement. Additionally, the results of this study were verified against other researchers[U+05F3] data and correlations, with varying outcomes.
