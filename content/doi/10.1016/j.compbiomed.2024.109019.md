## Abstract
Recent clinical studies have reported that heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) can be divided into two phenotypes based on the range of ejection fraction (EF), namely HFpEF with higher EF and HFpEF with lower EF. These phenotypes exhibit distinct left ventricle (LV) remodelling patterns and dynamics. However, the influence of LV remodelling on various LV functional indices and the underlying mechanics for these two phenotypes are not well understood. To address these issues, this study employs a coupled finite element analysis (FEA) framework to analyse the impact of various ventricular remodelling patterns, specifically concentric remodelling (CR), concentric hypertrophy (CH), and eccentric hypertrophy (EH), with and without LV wall thickening on LV functional indices. Further, the geometries with a moderate level of remodelling from each pattern are subjected to fibre stiffening and contractile impairment to examine their effect in replicating the different features of HFpEF. The results show that with severe CR, LV could exhibit the characteristics of HFpEF with higher EF, as observed in recent clinical studies. Controlled fibre stiffening can simultaneously increase the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) and reduce the peak longitudinal strain (ell) without significant reduction in EF, facilitating the moderate CR geometries to fit into this phenotype. Similarly, fibre stiffening can assist the CH and ‘EH with wall thickening’ cases to replicate HFpEF with lower EF. These findings suggest that potential treatment for these two phenotypes should target the bio-origins of their distinct ventricular remodelling patterns and the extent of myocardial stiffening.
