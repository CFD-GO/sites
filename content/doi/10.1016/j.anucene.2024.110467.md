## Abstract
Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent flow at the entrance to an annular pipe section has been performed. The flow over a single circular rod, coaxially immersed in a circular pipe is considered. The Reynolds number, based on mean velocity and hydraulic diameter of the annular section, is ReDh=40530. The study aims to gain insights into the turbulence characteristics of the primary and secondary separation bubbles, developing on a side surface of the rod. Key findings include tiny toroidal vortices in the primary bubble's front, forming a vortex train with intermittently shed vortex structures. Large-scale helical stripes have been reproduced at the entrance to the annular section. Tilting of the axially-oriented streaks was observed close to the rod surface. It resulted in a slight anisotropy of the normal Reynolds stresses. The LES data could refine classic Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes-based turbulence models.
