## Abstract
Hydraulic fracturing, which aims at creating highly-connected fracture networks and a successful delivery of proppant to these fractures, has emerged as one of the primary techniques to improve the production of shale oil and gas. Considering the unique layered structure and the strong heterogeneity of shale in the Qingshankou Formation, Songliao Basin, China, an effective propping of the horizontal bedding fractures could potentially boost the oil and gas production. In this study, the permeability of proppant packs within the horizontal bedding fractures is investigated both experimentally and numerically. Specifically, we focus on the propping effect of a partial monolayer, aiming for an optimal packing ratio (OPR) of proppant particles with which the resultant fracture permeability reaches the maximum. An experimental workflow is firstly established to evaluate the permeability of the partially-propped fractures using the selected shale. The non-linear variation between the permeability of natural bedding fractures and the proppant packing ratio is demonstrated experimentally for the first time, and the critical OPR falls within the range of 0.2 â€“ 0.4. Numerical simulations using the lattice Boltzmann-modified partially saturated method (LB-MPSM) provide further investigations on fracture porosity and aperture under confining stress, which shed light on the permeability results. Numerical results indicate that the fracture porosity reaches the maximum when the proppant packing ratio ranges between 0.3 and 0.4 under confining stress, and the increase in fracture aperture retards above a proppant packing ratio of 0.4. The research outcome contributes towards an improved understanding of the permeability of propped shale fractures filled with a partial proppant monolayer, which facilitates a better hydraulic fracturing design as well as an improved well productivity.
