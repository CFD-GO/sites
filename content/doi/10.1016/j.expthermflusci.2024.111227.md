## Abstract
The paper discusses experimental results on the effect of broadband acoustic excitation on laminar-to-turbulent transition in a separated shear layer developing on a flat plate subjected to an adverse pressure gradient (APG) and freestream turbulence level equal to Tu ≅ 1 %. The study encompasses the influence of Reynolds number (Rex = 185 000 and 370 000) and sound pressure level (SPL). The inherent complexity of the problem is simplified by providing an acoustic excitation from a controlled source (loudspeaker), acting on the boundary layer developing on the flat plate with a given streamwise pressure gradient. Two types of instabilities were identified in the pre-transitional boundary layer in unexcited flows. One was related to the inviscid Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability, while the second one was associated with formation of streamwise-oriented Klebanoff streaks (so-called Klebanoff mode). In the low Reynolds number case (Rex = 185 000), the K-H was responsible for transition onset, while in the high Reynolds number flow (Rex = 370 000), the Klebanoff distortions dominated the turbulent breakdown with the minor effect of the K-H instability. In addition to the naturally developing boundary layer, the flow was exposed to a pink noise characterized by SPL = 125 dB and 135 dB. In the low Reynolds number case, the acoustic excitation enhanced the K-H instability. It resulted in an earlier laminar-to-turbulent transition in case with higher sound pressure level (135 dB). In the high Reynolds number flow, the acoustic excitation enhanced the mixed-type transition mechanism with dominant role of the Klebanoff streaks. Shrinking or complete suppression of the separation bubbles was observed, depending on the applied sound pressure level (125 and 135 dB).
