## Abstract
The predictive qualities of a recently developed algebraic intermittency model for laminar-to-turbulent transition are analysed for the flow through a linear cascade of low-pressure turbine blades with an endwall. Both steady RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes) and time-accurate RANS (URANS) simulations are performed. The results are compared with reference LES (Large Eddy Simulation) by Cui et al. (2017, Numerical investigation of secondary flows in a high-lift low pressure turbine, Int. J. of Heat and Fluid Flow, vol. 63) and results by the local correlation-based intermittency transport model (LCTM) by Menter et al. (2015, A one-equation local correlation-based transition model. Flow Turbul. Combust., vol. 95) for laminar and turbulent endwall boundary layers at the cascade entrance. Good agreement is obtained with the reference LES and with results by the LCTM for the evolution through the cascade of the mass-averaged total pressure loss coefficient and for profiles of pitchwise-averaged total pressure loss coefficient at the cascade exit.
