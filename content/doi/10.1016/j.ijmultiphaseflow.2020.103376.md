## Abstract
Â© 2020 Elsevier LtdA three-dimensional phase-field lattice Boltzmann method has been applied to investigate the rise of Taylor bubbles within annular pipes. The approach couples the conservative phase-field model with a velocity-based lattice Boltzmann scheme. The implementation uses 27 discrete velocities to resolve both the interfacial dynamics and the hydrodynamics. To assist numerical stability for the high-density ratio, two-phase flows a weighted multiple-relaxation-time collision operator is employed. This paper makes contributions in three areas. First, the model is employed to capture the behaviour of Taylor bubbles in five combinations of vertical annular pipes, with results compared to experimental findings from the literature for air-water flows. From this, shortcomings were identified in the ability of existing correlations to accurately predict rise velocities for bubbles in various liquids. Second, the effect of pipe inclination on the rise behaviour of the bubbles was investigated. From the findings, a preliminary correlation describing the rise velocity was proposed. The first two components of the study were conducted with the Taylor bubble rising in stagnant fluid. The final component of this study imposed liquid flow in a concentric annular pipe to determine the impact of this on the bubble's dynamics. The liquid velocity was defined through a Reynolds number based on the average inlet velocity up to an absolute value of 10. The viscosity was varied to examine Morton numbers from 2.56e-3 to 6.55e-5. To this end both co- and counter-current flow was analysed and a distribution parameter proposed to capture the liquid-gas interaction. To extend this work, future investigations will look to extend the parameter range assessed to ensure the universality of the correlations identified.
