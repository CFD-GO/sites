## Abstract
Static formation temperature should be determined as accurately as possible for a number of reasons; especially it is an essential parameter in petroleum system modeling. In this study, the commonly used empirical methods for log derived temperature correction are reviewed. After that, new correlation was developed by adapting previously presented methods to calibrate log recorded temperature by using true formation temperature from reservoir tests like DST and MDT in Persian Gulf basin. A correction factor formula was proposed by considering both depth and TSC directly. The adapted method provides an accurate calibration of log recorded temperature.In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to reveal the effect of log recorded temperature calibration on 1D petroleum system modeling.
