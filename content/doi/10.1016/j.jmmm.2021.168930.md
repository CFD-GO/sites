## Abstract
Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.Magnetorheological plastomers (MRPs) are smart fluids whose rheological properties make them suitable for suspension systems, structural engineering, electrical transmission lines, medical applications, and agricultural engineering. In this paper, an integrated model of computational fluid mechanics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) is used to investigate the dynamic characteristics and the controllable damping force of shear-mode MRP dampers. An MRP with 60% weight ratio of soft-magnetic carbonyl iron powder (CIP) to the prepared plastic polyurethane matrix (MRP60) is used in the analysis. First. the magnetic field-dependent shear stress of MRP60 is calculated based on the relationship between the shear stress and the magnetic strength. Next, the shear stress and the strain rate are used in the CFD analysis to determine the flow and pressure fields as well as the variation of the damping force with the piston displacement, the piston velocity and the time for different sinusoidal motion frequencies and input currents. The results indicate that MRP dampers have the capacity to be used in semi-active applications.
