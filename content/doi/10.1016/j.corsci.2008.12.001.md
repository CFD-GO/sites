## Abstract
The influence of heat transfer on anodic oxide growth during anodizing of high purity Al is studied on a laboratory scale in a wall-jet electrode reactor under different flow conditions. Local electrode temperatures are monitored by temperature measurements on the backside of the anode, whereas the effect of local temperature on film growth is evaluated by FE-SEM analyses. Quantitative information on the conditions of heat transfer is provided by numerical calculations of the flow field, and is applied during simulations of the anodizing process. The impact of the flow field, calculated by two different turbulence models, on the simulations is verified. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
