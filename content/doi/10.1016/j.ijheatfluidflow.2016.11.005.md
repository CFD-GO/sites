## Abstract
This study examines the use of a lattice Boltzmann method framework to study heat transfer behaviours within particle suspensions. This has been done through the use of an adapted interface condition to attempt to resolve the required continuity of temperature and flux at the boundary between the solid and fluid phases. The proposed method is tested against analytical solutions for layered media in both a 1D bar and a radial layout. These tests showed that the model was able to generate results with first order convergence towards the analytical outcomes. The model was then used to examine the behaviour of two moving particles travelling along a channel to illustrate its potential for resolving complex suspension flows.
