## Abstract
The application of spectral filter fluids (SFF) in concentrated photovoltaic thermal (CPV/T) collectors is becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to improve energy yield by reducing the photovoltaic (PV) cell temperature. Such an integrated system is also known as spectral filter CPV/T (SF-CPV/T). The material used to construct a PV cell in a SF-CPV/T possesses a specific wavelength window, known as the ideal spectral response (ISR), within which the transmittance is higher and PV power generation is maximised. ISR could be varied depending on the context of PV spectral response and solar spectrum. In this work, a coupled numerical approach that combines modelling of radiation, electrical, and thermal power has been developed and applied to study the behaviour of a SF-CPV/T with SFF. Five commercial solar fluids, namely Therminol速VP1, 5 g/L CoSO4, Therminol速66, Duratherm S, and Dowtherm A, were investigated due to their good optical transmittance and stability at high operating temperature. A merit function was defined and calculated to assess each fluid's performance and economic feasibility. It was found that the viscosity of the fluid has the greatest effect on increasing the bulk fluid temperature, followed by other thermophysical properties. Non-dimensional analysis of the collector indicates that, when using 5 g/L CoSO4, the collector length must be longer to achieve the same power output as when using Therminol速66 under the same operating conditions. However, Therminol速VP1 was found to result in a higher merit function, especially when the worth factor was higher. By including the ideal spectrum criteria for the PV cell and non-dimensional analysis of the candidate solar fluids and band-dependent optical parameters in the numerical modelling, the performance of the SF-CPV/T collector can be more accurately predicted. To extend this work, future investigation will look into the influence of the heat loss coefficients and the local climate conditions on the performance of the collector. Additionally, methodological development to include band-based solar radiation and multiphase modelling of the nanofluid will be conducted to further improve model accuracy.
