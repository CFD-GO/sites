## Abstract
© 2021 Elsevier B.V.The Lattice Boltzmann Method algorithm is simplified by assuming constant numerical viscosity (the relaxation time is fixed at τ=1). This leads to the removal of the distribution function from the computer memory. To test the solver the Poiseuille and Driven Cavity flows are simulated and analyzed. The error of the solution decreases with the grid size L as L−2. Compared to the standard algorithm, the presented formulation is simpler and shorter in implementation. It is less error-prone and needs significantly less working memory in low Reynolds number flows. Our tests showed that the algorithm is less efficient in multiphase flows. To overcome this problem, further extension and the moments-only formulation was derived, inspired by the Multi-Relaxation Time (MRT) approach for single component multiphase flows.
