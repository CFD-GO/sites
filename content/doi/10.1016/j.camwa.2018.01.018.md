## Abstract
Modelling the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic interactions of suspended particles is a significant and ongoing numerical challenge. Addressing this is necessary in order to be able to fully model numerous industrial and scientific processes of practical interest. This paper describes extensions to a local and a non-local technique for the calculation of transient conjugate heat transfer within a lattice Boltzmann framework. The interface transition between phases in both methods has been incorporated via a partially saturated boundary condition that weights material properties and allows straight and curved boundaries to be captured. Transient and steady-state performance of the two methods has been compared using a number of static and dynamic problems to evaluate their suitability for modelling particle suspensions. In a number of the static tests the non-local method produced better results however for the dynamic cases the local method demonstrated more accurate behaviour.
