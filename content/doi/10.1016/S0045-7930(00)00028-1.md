## Abstract
Effectiveness of three methods for simulation of flows over corrugated/rough boundaries has been analyzed. Domain perturbation method, which approximates shape of the boundary, is applicable to corrugation amplitudes up to 10-1 and provides accuracy no better than O(10-1) for such conditions. Its absolute accuracy significantly increases for lower amplitudes especially when higher-order versions of the method are used. Domain transformation method (DTM) enforces flow boundary conditions exactly, provides spectral accuracy but is very laborious in implementation due to a very complex form of the field equations. Direct method (DM) enforces flow boundary conditions with spectral accuracy and is simple in implementation. DM is recommended for most applications. When either corrugation amplitude or its wave number becomes excessively large, DTM is recommended due to its better mode efficiency. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
