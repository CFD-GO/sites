## Abstract
The qualities of a DES (Detached Eddy Simulation) and a PANS (Partially-Averaged Navier-Stokes) hybrid RANS/LES model, both based on the k-ω RANS turbulence model of Wilcox (2008, "Formulation of the k-ω turbulence model revisited" AIAA J., 46: 2823-2838), are analysed for simulation of plane impinging jets at a high nozzle-plate distance (H/B= 10, Re = 13,500; H is nozzle-plate distance, B is slot width; Reynolds number based on slot width and maximum velocity at nozzle exit) and a low nozzle-plate distance (H/. B= 4, Re = 20,000). The mean velocity field, fluctuating velocity components, Reynolds stresses and skin friction at the impingement plate are compared with experimental data and LES (Large Eddy Simulation) results. The k- ω DES model is a double substitution type, following Davidson and Peng (2003, "Hybrid LES-RANS modelling: a one-equation SGS model combined with a k- ω model for predicting recirculating flows" Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids, 43: 1003-1018). This means that the turbulent length scale is replaced by the grid size in the destruction term of the k-equation and in the eddy viscosity formula. The k- ω PANS model is derived following Girimaji (2006, "Partially-Averaged Navier-Stokes model for turbulence: a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes to Direct Numerical Simulation bridging method" J. Appl. Mech., 73: 413-421). The turbulent length scale in the PANS model is constructed from the total turbulent kinetic energy and the sub-filter dissipation rate. Both hybrid models change between RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) and LES based on the cube root of the cell volume. The hybrid techniques, in contrast to RANS, are able to reproduce the turbulent flow dynamics in the shear layers of the impacting jet. The change from RANS to LES is much slower however for the PANS model than for the DES model on fine enough grids. This delays the break-up process of the vortices generated in the shear layers with as a consequence that the DES model produces better results than the PANS model. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.
