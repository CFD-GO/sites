## Abstract
Flight like droplet impact with superhydrophobic substrate in conditions favour icing is discussed in this work. Test stand with fast camera and equipment eligible to obtain temperatures and humidity at different ranges, lead to results which can prove, that superhydrophobic surface might be good ice repellent substrate. The influence of air humidity on droplet freezing was confirmed.
