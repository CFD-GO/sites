## Abstract
Fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics are presented for simulations of round impinging jets at two nozzle-plate distances H/D=2 and 10 (D is the nozzle exit diameter) and two Reynolds numbers Re=5000 and 70,000 with hybrid RANS/LES (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes/Large Eddy Simulation), dynamic Smagorinsky LES and RANS k-ω models. Three k-ω based hybrid RANS/LES models are analyzed. With the hybrid RANS/LES models, improved heat transfer results are obtained, when compared to RANS, in the impact region and in the developing wall-jet region. For accurate predictions at low nozzle-plate distance, it is necessary to sufficiently resolve the formation and development of the near-wall vortices in the jet impingement region. At high nozzle-plate distance, it is important to capture the evolution and breakup of the unsteady vortices in the shear layer of the jet, so that realistic mean and fluctuating velocity profiles are obtained in the impact jet region.
