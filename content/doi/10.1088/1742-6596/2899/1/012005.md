## Abstract
The efficiency of stirring in the laminar mixing protocol resulting from the action by the nonstationary laminar flow through a longitudinally corrugated channel is evaluated using the negative exponent Sobolev norm of the concentration - the Mix-Norm. The Mix-norm is applied to a range of stirring velocity fields, resulting from the low Reynolds number destabilisation of the flow through a corrugated channel. The results are compared to the well-known quantifying measure, the concentration variance. The ability of the Mix-norm to include the stirring effect at the increasing PÃ©clet number is illustrated.
