## Abstract
The predictive qualities of a newly developed algebraic intermittency model are analysed by simulation of the flow through a linear cascade of low pressure turbine (LPT) blades with endwalls. Both steady RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) and time-accurate RANS (URANS) simulations are performed. The results are compared with reference LES (Large Eddy Simulation) by Cui et al. (2017, Numerical investigation of secondary flows in a high-lift low pressure turbine, Int. J. of Heat and Fluid Flow, vol. 63) for a turbulent endwall boundary layer (TBL) at the entrance to the cascade. Good agreement is obtained between simulations with the algebraic model and the reference LES for the evolution of the mass-averaged total pressure loss coefficient and for profiles of pitchwise-averaged turbulent kinetic energy.
