## Abstract
A flow simulation through a four-stage low pressure turbine (LPT) of aero-engine, using eddy-viscosity based RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) model, is performed. The numerical results are compared with experimental data obtained in Polonia Aero Lab in Zielonka, Poland. Good agreement between measured and predicted global flow features and the pressure coefficient on surface of inlet strut is reported. The development of vortex structures in inlet duct of the low pressure turbine (LPT), named a turbine central frame (TCF), is analysed. An analysis of secondary flow losses by means of entropy generation rate coefficient is provided.
