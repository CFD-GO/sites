## Abstract
Experimental results on laminar-to-turbulent transition in a separated laminar boundary layer formed over a flat plate in an adverse pressure gradient are provided. Experiments have been performed for a range of Reynolds numbers (1.4 - 2.4 Â· 105) and for two freestream turbulence levels (Tu =3.6 and 5.3%). The measurements of mean and fluctuating velocity profiles have been carried out at inlet to the test section using Constant Temperature Anemometry (CTA). The data might be useful for validation and development of transition models. In order to characterize the dynamics leading to the transition process in the separated boundary layer on the plate surface, the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements have been performed. The results show that the transition process in the separated boundary layer is influenced by breakdown of the Klebanoff streaks.
