## Abstract
Â© 2017 IEEE.Hollow-Core Photonic Crystal Fibres (HC PCFs) provide a microscale cell for fast response optical gas sensing. This paper presents a computational simulation of flow behaviour of methane and hydrogen gases in HC-PCFs under ambient pressure and temperature. A mathematical model has been developed to study the gas diffusion time in different structures and lengths of HC-PCF. The results show the relation of gas concentration over time along the length of HC-PCF's core.
