## Abstract
© 2015 IEEE.In this contribution we present interferometrie time series analysis of ALOS PALSAR images acquired between 2007 and 2011 for the Rabaul Caldera, situated at the north-eastern point of New Britain Island in Papua New Guinea. During this time period, a broad subsidence signal is observed across the caldera, followed by a period of uplift. These signals are thought to originate from deflation and inflation (respectively) from a magma chamber situated at 4.258°S, 152.182°E and a depth of 4.5 km beneath Rabaul Harbor. Using a Mogi point source model, we infer the time series of volume change in this magma chamber and deduce a deflation rate of ∼10×106 m3 yr-1 during 2008 and 2009 and an inflation rate of ∼7×106 m3 yr-1 during 2010 and early 2011.
