## Abstract
A simple method is proposed for simulation of impinging jet mass transfer at high Schmidt numbers. Two variants of algebraic models, based on the limiting behaviour of the turbulent diffusivity Dt for y+ → 0, are employed in order to provide Dt in the near-wall region while away from walls a formula based on the ratio of turbulent to molecular viscosity (∨t/∨) is applied for determination of the turbulent Schmidt number. Blending between the algebraic expressions and the formula for ∨t/∨ is performed in the buffer region of the boundary layer, making the model independent of y+ at larger distances from the walls. With the proposed models, very good results have been obtained for the mass transfer at high Schmidt number in impinging jet flows. The model also functions well at low Schmidt number.
