## Abstract
© 2021 EAGE Publications BV.The carbonate reservoir is one of the most “inconvenient” and challenging reservoir types that a geologist encounters in his daily work. The complex pore space of the carbonate reservoir is associated with secondary porosity, the appearance of which is facilitated by processes such as leaching, dolomitization, recrystallization and fracturing. Due to these processes, the primary matrix is transformed, and the reservoir properties are no longer controlled by the lithofacies. In other words, rocks deposited in similar geological conditions can have completely different reservoir properties. This paper presents the results of testing the hypothesis for identifying rock types by clustering well logging and geological substantiation of the identified groups. At the first stage, clustering algorithms helped to divide the values of the curves into groups with specific responses. Further, the data on the lithological description of the core, capillary pressure curves, as well as curves of relative permeabilities made it possible to substantiate the correctness of the identified clusters.
