## Abstract
The forecasted growth in dynamic global air fleet size in the coming decades, together with the need to introduce disruptive technologies supporting net-zero emission air transport, demands more efficient design and optimization workflows. This research focuses on developing an aerodynamic optimization framework suited for multi-objective studies of small aircraft engine air-intake ducts in multiple flight conditions. In addition to the refinement of the duct’s performance criteria, the work aims to improve the economic efficiency of the process. The optimization scheme combines the advantages of Kriging-based Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) with the Radial Basis Functions (RBF)-based mesh morphing technique and the Chebyshev-type Achievement Scalarizing Function (ASF) for handling multiple objectives and design points. The proposed framework is applied to an aerodynamic optimization study of an I-31T aircraft turboprop engine intake system. The workflow successfully reduces the air-duct pressure losses and mitigates the flow distortion at the engine compressor’s front face in three considered flight phases. The results prove the framework’s potential for solving complex multi-point air-intake duct problems and the capacity of the ASF-based formulation to guide optimization toward the designer’s preferred objective targets.
