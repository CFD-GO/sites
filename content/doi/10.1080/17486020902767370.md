## Abstract
The objective of the paper is to present the essential issues related to an effective computational implementation of a continuum/discontinuum formulation of rock masses under various loading conditions, including fluid interaction for three classes of problems; fluid flow through fracturing rock masses, rock blasting and the transport of large particles through a fluid medium. The applicability of the methodology developed is illustrated through a selection of practical examples.
