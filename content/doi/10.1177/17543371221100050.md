## Abstract
Reducing the level of aerodynamic drag (CdA) via use of a wind tunnel will ultimately improve a competitive cyclists performance. Whilst this tool is widely considered a ‘gold standard’, previous studies have centred on single riders or scale models to evaluate aerodynamic drag. No study to date has assessed the precision of wind tunnel testing with the additional perceived complexity of a tandem bicycle with a pair of competitive paracyclists. The first part of this investigation evaluated the use of a wind tunnel in the assessment of tandem paracyclists. A male and female team of paracyclists riding tandem versions of either a time trial track bicycle or a road/time trial bicycle undertook a series of measurement intervals in a wind tunnel. Three different combinations of these riders and bicycles obtained a Coefficient of Variation of their mean CdA of 1.8%–2.6%. The second part of this investigation acted as a case study by implementing a range of aerodynamic interventions to potentially reduce the male team’s CdA. For example, progressive efforts reduced a team’s CdA from the baseline of 0.338 m2 to ultimately 0.321 m2 predominately by lowering both tandem riders heads Whilst tandem cyclist performance enhancement has recieved scant attention in the past, this case study only highlights the value of doing so in the future.
