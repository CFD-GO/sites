## Abstract
The behavior of two-dimensional Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves in the presence of suction nonuniformities that induce flow modifications of the magnitude comparable to the magnitude of the TS waves was analyzed in the context of plane Poiseuille flow. It was found that small suction nonuniformities may affect the flow instability only if they contain the critical or near-critical suction waves.
