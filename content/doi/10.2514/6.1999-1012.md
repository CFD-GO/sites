## Abstract
Modifications of channel flow induced by small external forcing in the form of distributed surface suction are analyzed using linear theory. The analysis relies on singular decomposition of the relevant operator. Generalization of the results to an arbitrary forcing is described. The form of the “optimal” forcing, i.e., forcing that produces the largest possible response, is determined. The maximum possible response to distributed suction is found. It is shown that this response may change by several orders of magnitude, depending on the suction’s wave number and wave speed. Results of this analysis provide data required for design and optimization of flow control systems.
