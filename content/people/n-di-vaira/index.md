Nathan Di Vaira is a post-doctoral researcher within the School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering at the Univeristy of Queensland. In March 2023 he is expecting to gain his PhD in mechanical engineering from UQ, where he also obtained a BE(Hons) with Class I honours. Nathan has prior experience in the resources sector working for BHP and has gained exposure to electricity market modelling via a PhD industry placement with Ernst & Young.

**Research**

Nathan is an expert in computational modelling of granular micro-particle suspensions. His research is primarily focussed on high-fidelity modelling of subsurface flows in fractured and porous media, using the lattice Boltzmann method and discrete element method, including the simulation of non-Newtonian and physicochemical physics.

During his PhD Nathan made fundamental discoveries relating to the migration of polydisperse particle suspensions, published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics (JFM) ([link](/content/publications/2022-DiVaira-Laniewski-JFM.md)), as well as clogging in planar channels under electrostatic forces via a novel stochastic methodology, also published in JFM ([link](/content/publications/2023-DiVaira-Laniewski-JFM.md)). Through his PhD thesis and several conference presentations and papers, these fundamental insights were positioned in the context of particle flows through fracture networks, providing the basis for innovative simulation methods for stimulation of natural gas reservoirs via proppant injection.

In his current role with the MCF group Nathan is exploring particulate flows through more complex geometries, including realistically-textured fractures, bifurcating channels and percolation through particle packs. 

**Broader Interests**

Nathan is motivated by the Energy Transition and solving quantitative problems with his modelling expertise, and is looking to solve the general challenges which arise during the looming energy crisis. He is associated with the Centre for Multiscale and Renewable Energy Systems (CMRES) at UQ, and also has a passion for teaching at a university level, having obtained the status of Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.
