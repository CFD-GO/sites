Dr. Nathan Di Vaira is a post-doctoral researcher within the School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering at the Univeristy of Queensland (UQ). He holds a PhD in mechanical engineering from UQ, as well as a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours). Nathan has prior experience in the resources sector working for BHP and has gained exposure to electricity market modelling via a PhD industry placement with Ernst & Young.

**Research**

Nathan is an expert in computational fluid dynamics of granular micro-particle suspensions. His research is primarily focused on high-fidelity modelling of subsurface flows in fractured and porous media, using the lattice Boltzmann method and discrete element method, including the simulation of non-Newtonian and physicochemical physics.

During his PhD Nathan made fundamental discoveries relating to the [migration of polydisperse particle suspensions](/doi/10.1017/jfm.2022.166), as well as [micro-particle clogging under electrostatic forces](/doi/10.1017/jfm.2023.214), both works being published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics. Through his PhD thesis and several conference presentations and papers, these fundamental insights were positioned in the context of particle flows through fracture networks, providing the basis for innovative simulation methods for stimulation of natural gas reservoirs via proppant injection.

In his current role with the MCF group Nathan is exploring particulate flows through more complex geometries, including realistically-textured fractures, bifurcating channels and percolation through particle packs. 

**Broader Interests**

Nathan is motivated by the Energy Transition and solving its myriad associated problems with his modelling expertise. He is associated with the Centre for Multiscale Energy Systems at UQ, and also has a passion for teaching at a university level, having obtained the status of Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.
