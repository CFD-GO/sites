The MCF group was founded in 2016 by [A/Prof Christopher Leonardi](people/c-leonardi) and [Dr Travis Mitchell](people/t-mitchell) to bring together a team of researchers interested in the study of complex fluid systems in the energy and resources sector. The group has significant experience in the computational modelling of multiphase systems and has developed advanced capability in capturing non-Newtonian effects, particle suspensions, realistic complex geometries (synthetic rough fractures and microCT porous media), heat transfer, and bubble/droplet dynamics. As a team, we seek to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that drive progress in the chemical, energy, and resource industries.
