The MCF group, founded in 2016 by [A/Prof Christopher Leonardi](people/c-leonardi) and [Dr Travis Mitchell](people/t-mitchell), is a team of researchers at The University of Queensland dedicated to investigating complex fluid systems. Our group is comprised of experts in non-Newtonian behaviours, particle suspensions, multiphase dynamics, heat transfer, and more. By using advanced computational tools, we aim to uncover insights into the behaviour of fluids in a variety of industrial applications, including natural gas extraction, hydraulic fracturing, catalytic reformer systems, liquid-gas instabilities, and bubble reactor dynamics. As a team, we seek to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that drive progress in the chemical, energy, and resource industries.
